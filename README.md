# 🎯 Project Overview

CoachBot AI is a Generative AI-powered web application that delivers personalized, injury-aware, and position-specific sports coaching plans for young athletes.

The system integrates **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro API** with a **Streamlit-based web interface** to simulate a certified youth sports coach and generate structured training recommendations.

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be applied to solve real-world problems in youth sports development.

---

# 🚀 Problem Statement

Many young athletes lack:

- Access to professional coaching
- Personalized workout programs
- Injury-safe recovery guidance
- Tactical intelligence support
- Proper nutrition planning

CoachBot AI addresses this gap using AI-generated structured coaching outputs tailored to individual athlete profiles.

---

# 💡 Solution Design

The application collects structured user input:

- Sport
- Position
- Age
- Injury history
- Training goal
- Diet preference
- Intensity level
- Coach personality style

Based on this data, the AI generates:

1. Weekly training plan (Mon–Sun)
2. Warm-up and cooldown routines
3. Injury-safe adjustments
4. Tactical coaching advice
5. Nutrition plan
6. Hydration strategy
7. Mental preparation tips
8. Recovery strategy
9. Performance tracking metrics
10. Motivational feedback
